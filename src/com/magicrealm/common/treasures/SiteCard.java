/*
 * When a character draws one of these cards, he turns it face up and crosses it off his Discoveries list 
 * (this is the only way a Site card can be discovered by searching). 
 * Then he returns it to the box he drew it from, at the bottom of the pile of treasures in that box, face up. 
 * The card stays in that box, but it is assumed to be in the same clearing with that box's chit. 
 * If several Site cards are in the same box, the one that was drawn most recently is the one that is on the bottom of the pile. 
 * When a character is in the same clearing with a Site card that he has crossed off, he can use Search phases to loot it. 
 * He must use the special table for that card - he cannot use the Loot table (nor Magic Sight) to loot a site card. 
 * He rolls two dice and uses the high roll to find his result, and all die roll modifications that apply to Loot rolls apply to his roll. 
 * The table for each Site card is given below, and an abbreviated version is shown on the Set Up Card.
